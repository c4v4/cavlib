# cavlib
A collection of C++ utilities I frequently reuse in my projects.

All the utilities you find here have been built and tuned around my specific needs (hence the name). In the future, some components might disappear or be completely changed, so there is no guarantee about the stability of the code. For the same reason, this library assumes that it will be compiled using the C++20 standard with the clang/gcc compiler on Linux machines.

## List of content:

## Why make it public?
There are a couple of reasons:

- I want to have it as a separate library, and if it is public, I can be free to use it even in my public repositories.
- I would be very happy if some discussion were to generate from this (though I don't expect it to happen). I like to make my (sometimes) strong opinions collide with others as a way of reciprocal contamination.
- I want to have a repo that evolves with me, showcasing my current state as a software developer. In the past few years, I have mostly coded only on "private" projects, either because there was a hard requirement or because I didn't consider my work completed or worthy to be public.

 ## Style Summary
Here's an unsorted list of principles I try to follow:

- Refactor-Oriented Programming: If an abstraction doesn't fit well its purpose, feel free to change, remove, split, merge, or do whatever it takes to fix it,  even if it means spending days on a refactor. Minor inconveniences add up, so it's better to deal with them now than later when it will be much more painful. Moreover, the pleasure to work with well thought abstractions outweight the hustle of the refactor (which is also a mean of exploring new ideas and improving as a developer). The simplest example of this approach translates into the following point.

- If you remember the name of a function wrong, rename it with the wrong name. This usually converges into a small set of names (usually one) that are equally reasonable to you. The main benefits are that the names become meaningful, and often, you don't have to remember the name but just think, "How would I name it?" and it works.

- User code: (aka: my code in other repositories that depend on this one) should be  **simple and clear&#8482;**. What this means changes over time with my personal opinion and taste, but at the time of this writing, it can be summarized as:
    - Avoid direct allocations (use library code for that).
    - Put asserts everywhere (both comptime and runtime).
    - Debug vs Release build: provide a version able to detected and fail on errors
    - Be explicit with functions (nodiscard, noexcept, const, ...).
    - Prefer objects with full public members.
    - Use default-constructible aggregate objects.
    - Defer all complexities to library code (e.g., allocations, template metaprogramming shenanigans, nifty abstractions, etc.).
    - User code shoud be understood by C programmes that never learnt C++ idioms.
    - Feel free to ignore any of the previous rules if you have a valid reason.

- Library code: This repository should contain library code. Library code is free to do whatever hideous things are necessary to expose a useful, clean, and performant abstraction.

## Comments
I'm confident that all the nifty or horrific ideas you might encounter here can easily be found in many other open-source C++ libraries. I don't expect you'll find anything original here.

This is a simple snapshot of what I enjoy writing when I'm coding in C++.
My coding style has evolved with time, influenced by commonly suggested best practices but mainly by firsthand experiences and thoughts.

Feel free to contact me for anythingâ€”whether you like or dislike something, have suggestions or critiques, or if you'd like to do something similar to a thing that you found here and want to know more about how it works.

## Todos:
- I need to start writing unit tests systematically. All the components have been used at a certain point in time in one or more projects, but this is far to consider them bug-free. In a way, the constexpr testing facilities in `test.hpp`` mitigate this point, but they are far from fix it.
- The documentation is pretty much non-existent. For many meta-functions or simple utilities it is not a problem (since they are small enough to be self-explanatory). For larger components I need to add, at the very least, a form of contract.
